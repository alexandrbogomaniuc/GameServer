  <h1>Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
  <p>If you connected IGW Social Casino using Facebook/Instagram, you can request deletion of your account data as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:SUPPORT_EMAIL">SUPPORT_EMAIL</a> from the address linked to your account, with subject “Data Deletion Request”. Include your internal User ID (if known) or the Facebook/Instagram ID/username.</li>
    <li>Or disconnect our app in your Facebook/Instagram account settings. We will receive a deauthorization signal and remove/anonimize your personal data associated with that connection within 30 days, except what we must retain for security and legal obligations.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For transparency, we typically delete or anonymize: profile identifiers, session tokens, wallet ownership, and logs tied to your identity. Aggregated gameplay stats may be retained without personal identifiers.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions, contact <a href="mailto:SUPPORT_EMAIL">SUPPORT_EMAIL</a>.</p>
