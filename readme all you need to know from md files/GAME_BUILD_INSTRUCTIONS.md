# Game Loading Fix - Final Steps

## 🎯 Problem Found
The dragonstone game has **source code** but not **built files**. It needs to be compiled with webpack first.

## ✅ What's Working
- ✅ BAV authentication
- ✅ Currency conversion  
- ✅ Session creation
- ✅ Template loading
- ✅ Static file serving (version.json loads!)
- ⏳ Game files need building

## 📋 Solution: Build the Game

The game is a modern JavaScript app that needs to be built with webpack before deployment.

### Option 1: Find Pre-Built Game Files
Check if there are already-built game files elsewhere in the project:

```powershell
# Search for built game.js
Get-ChildItem -Path "d:\OneDrive - Roan Solutions, Inc\DOCUMENTS\Igaming Project" -Filter "game.js" -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object FullName
```

If you find `game.js` files, one might be the built version for dragonstone.

### Option 2: Build the Game with Webpack
If no built files exist, you need to build them:

```powershell
# Navigate to lobby directory
cd "d:\OneDrive - Roan Solutions, Inc\DOCUMENTS\Igaming Project\Game provider side\Source code\mq-client-clean-version\dragonstone\lobby"

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Build the game
npm run build
```

This will create `game.js` in the lobby directory (or a `dist/` folder).

### Option 3: Use a Different Game
The other games in `mq-client-clean-version` might already be built:
- `/sectorx`
- `/revengeofra`  
- `/missionamazon`
- `/cashorcrash`

Check if any of these have `game.js` already built.

## 🔍 After Building

Once you have the built `game.js`:

1. **Copy built files to webapp**:
   ```powershell
   # If build creates dist/ folder:
   Copy-Item -Path "dragonstone/lobby/dist/*" -Destination "game-server/web-gs/src/main/webapp/html5pc/actiongames/dragonstone/lobby/" -Force
   
   # If build creates files in lobby/:
   # game.js will already be there
   ```

2. **Rebuild WAR**:
   ```powershell
   cd "d:\OneDrive - Roan Solutions, Inc\DOCUMENTS\Igaming Project\Game provider side\Source code\mq-gs-clean-version\game-server\web-gs"
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```powershell
   docker cp "target/ROOT.war" gp3-gs-1:/var/lib/jetty/webapps/ROOT.war
   docker exec gp3-gs-1 rm -rf /tmp/jetty-*
   docker restart gp3-gs-1
   ```

## 🎮 Alternative: Pre-Built Games Location

There might be a separate directory with already-compiled game files. Check:
- `Game provider side/Client files/`
- `Game provider side/deployed-games/`
- Any `dist/`, `build/`, or `public/` directories

Let me know what you find!
