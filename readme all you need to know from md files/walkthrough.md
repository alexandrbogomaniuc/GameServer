# Walkthrough: Game Loader Resolution

I have successfully resolved the issues preventing the game from launching and connecting to the server.

## 1. Resolved: HTTP 500 Server Error
The root cause was syntax and formatting corruption in `template.jsp`.
- **Fix:** Restored a clean `template.jsp` with corrected Java syntax.
- **Method:** Used a PowerShell HEREDOC to ensure zero formatting corruption during the write.
- **Verification:** The page now renders without errors, and PIXI.js initializes.

## 2. Resolved: WebSocket "undefined" Error
The game client was failing to connect because it expected `WEB_SOCKET_URL` in the Page URL parameters, but it was missing from the initial request.
- **Fix:** Implemented a **Self-Healing Redirect** script in `template.jsp`.
- **Logic:** If critical parameters like `WEB_SOCKET_URL` or `SID` are missing from the URL, the script automatically injects them and refreshes the page once.
- **Verification:** Browser logs now show a successful WebSocket connection:
  ```
  [WSIC] _onConnectionOpened
  ```

## 3. Documentation & Backups
- **Troubleshooting Guide:** Updated at [500_error_resolution.md](file:///e:/Dev/Igaming%20Project/readme%20all%20you%20need%20to%20know%20from%20md%20files/500_error_resolution.md)
- **Verified Backup:** A known good copy of `template.jsp` is saved at [active_template.jsp.bak](file:///e:/Dev/Igaming%20Project/readme%20all%20you%20need%20to%20know%20from%20md%20files/active_template.jsp.bak)

### Final System State
The game loader is now fully operational, parameters are correctly mapped, and the client successfully establishes its communication channel with the server.
